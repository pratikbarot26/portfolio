            Hi, I’m Pratik Mukesh Barot — a data engineer and analytics professional passionate about transforming raw data into scalable, meaningful solutions. I recently earned my MS in Information Systems from Syracuse University, alongside a Certificate of Advanced Study in Data Science.
From constructing batch pipelines and optimizing legacy systems to visualizing insights, I’m driven by the impact of well-engineered data solutions. I thrive in collaborative environments, document thoroughly, and align my work with both technical and business goals.
Naturally curious and solution-focused, I see data as a canvas for engineering, exploration, and innovation. Let’s connect if you're building with purpose too.
